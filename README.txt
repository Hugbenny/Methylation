Here are some scripts i made for the interpretation of methylation data from Infiniumâ„¢ MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850k and 450k) and from targeted bisulfite sequencing.

The EPIC data analysis was made using R with the ChAMP package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChAMP.html). It is just an interactive script allowing for easier use.
The Python scripts are made from scratch, and allow for diagrams generation with the percent of hypo/hypermethylated DMPs/DMRs. You also have the option to look for differentially methylated genes shared in different sample, and also methylated in the same way. You also have the option to look for genes that are more impacted in a sample or another (only available for 2 samples at the same time). Scripts also generates .csv tables as well as the diagrams. Just launch the Epic.py file with DMP.py and DMR.py in the same directory. The scripts are user-friendly and interactive.

The ampliez scripts are for targeted bisulfite sequencing (our datas were obtained from https://www.genewiz.com/en-GB/Public/Services/Next-Generation-Sequencing/Amplicon-Sequencing-Services/Amplicon-EZ?sc_device=Mobile). You need BiQAnalyzer to be installed (https://biq-analyzer.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and change the software path in the  ampliez-V2.R file. Beware that in the script, "DR1" needs to be replace with the name of your refseq to match the name of the directories generated by BiQ. A Windows compatible version of the file is available too.

Finally, the Episignature.R files uses the method described in Aref-Esghi et al. method from 2017 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7058829/) to generate list of probes of different length, and check the precision of the model (linear SVM from caret package https://github.com/topepo/caret). We used GSE125367 to increase the amount of controls in our population. A .Rmd file is also available for easier analysis of the different lists generated.
